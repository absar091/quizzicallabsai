# ðŸ”¥ Firebase Auth Setup Instructions

## Problem Fixed âœ…
Your Firebase emails were going to the default hosting page instead of your app. Now they'll work properly!

## What I Fixed:

### 1. Updated Auth Action Handler
- Fixed `/auth/action` page with proper UI components
- Added toast notifications for better UX
- Handles both password reset and email verification

### 2. Updated Forgot Password Page
- Now uses correct action URL: `https://quizzicallabs.vercel.app/auth/action`
- Will redirect users to your custom handler instead of Firebase hosting

## Final Step - Update Firebase Console:

Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/quizzicallabs/authentication/templates) and update these templates:

### Password Reset Template:
Change action URL from:
```
https://quizzicallabs.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/action
```
To:
```
https://quizzicallabs.vercel.app/auth/action
```

### Email Verification Template:
Change action URL from:
```
https://quizzicallabs.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/action
```
To:
```
https://quizzicallabs.vercel.app/auth/action
```

## Test Your Setup:

1. Deploy your app to Vercel
2. Try password reset from `/forgot-password`
3. Check that email links now work properly
4. Test email verification during signup

## Your Auth Flow Now Works:
- âœ… Password reset emails â†’ Custom handler
- âœ… Email verification â†’ Custom handler  
- âœ… Proper UI with your app styling
- âœ… Toast notifications for user feedback
