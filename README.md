## âœ¨ Features

Quizzicallabs AI is packed with features to cater to a wide range of educational needs:

-   **Exam Paper Generator**: A powerful tool for educators. Create professional, print-ready exam papers with custom headers (school name, teacher, marks), multiple variants to prevent cheating, a two-column layout to save paper, and an automatically generated answer key.
-   **MDCAT Preparation Module**: A specialized section for students preparing for the Medical & Dental College Admission Test. This module provides high-difficulty, past-paper style tests organized by subject (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, etc.) and chapter, simulating the real exam environment.

## ðŸ”’ Authentication and Security

User security and data privacy are top priorities for Quizzicallabs AI.

-   **Firebase Authentication**: We use Firebase Authentication for secure user sign-up and login. All passwords are encrypted, and user sessions are managed with industry-standard security protocols.
-   **Email Verification**: To ensure the validity of user accounts and prevent spam, all new users must verify their email address before they can log in.
-   **Data Security**: User data, including quiz results and bookmarks, is stored securely in Firebase's Realtime Database and Firestore. Our security rules are configured to ensure that users can only access their own data, preventing unauthorized access.
-   **Data Persistence**: For a seamless user experience, your quiz progress, bookmarks, and results are saved locally in your browser's IndexedDB and synced with Firebase. This means you can pick up right where you left off, even if you lose your internet connection.
